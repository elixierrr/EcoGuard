## **Executive Summary/Abstract**
In recent years, environmental issues such as air pollution, poor waste management, and industrial waste have increasingly degraded the quality of life and public health. Despite the urgency of these issues, existing reporting mechanisms often lack efficiency, accessibility, and actionable guidance. **EcoGuard** addresses these gaps by providing a user-friendly platform that empowers individuals to report environmental concerns directly through interactive maps. The platform visualizes these reports in real-time, enabling both users and authorities to identify critical hotspots quickly.
